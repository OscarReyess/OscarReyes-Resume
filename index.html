        <p class="lead mb-4">In high school, one of my favorite activities was being able to help out in my community. Being apart of a multitude of clubs allowed me to gain and understand knowledge regarding customer service and being able to lead at different projects. Many of the projects that we undertook as clubs were thought up in order to serve and entertain the community in a number of different ways. There was one instance in which we cleaned up the entirety of our local park in which helped me grow not only as a person but someone who was capable of being apart of something that was bigger than myself. Another project that I took great pride in was a community service event in which we put on a haunted maze experience at the local community center. During this, we were all in charge of our own areas with our peers and allowed to get as creative as possible in order to scare the people who entered into the maze. Doing this for two years in a row, it taught me adaptability and how to overcome any unexpected situation that may occur in any environment. <br><br>

        Responsibility and organization have always been skills that I have had great pleasure in having. Utilizing these skills whenever necessary in order to turn in work that I can put my name on and be proud of. These skills alone are not what make the best that I can be. It is also important to understand that someone with my age and knowledge can and always should, be ready to learn from those who have experience. Coming from an area in which everyone acts and looks the same, I have always appreciated being able to learn from others and their different perspectives and subjects that I always felt I knew like the back of my hand. Being empathetic and sympathetic, I have found, will allow me to excel in any area of business that I strive to be in because ultimately, business is about people and profits. <br><br>

        Having had the privilege of working at a customer satisfaction heavy job for nearly a year, I was able to gain experience and knowledge for the day to day operations of a business and how operations occur. Being at this entry-level job saw me having to adapt and overcome any situation that needed to be handled with the utmost urgency and accountability. Learning how to handle money and unsatisfied customers was something that no one can take away from me, and I am glad to have been able to gain that experience for the future employment that I will have. The last two years have allowed me to learn and grow not only for myself, but also for the future people that I will come into contact with during the tenure of my studies at the University of California at Riverside and also my future employers and co-workers. This is who I am and these are the lessons that I have learned along the way that will allow me to tackle the business world.
